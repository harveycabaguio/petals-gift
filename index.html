      <p><q>Hey Elliot</q> Harry suddenly appears and greets Elliot with his usual monotonous manner that he displays every time they meet. Elliot nods and continues to listen to music as they walk alongside each other. </p>
      <p>Warm gentle wind brushes past the boys&rsquo; faces as they walk towards the station to catch the train heading to the city. The warm weather serves as a reminder that the winter season is finally over and the hot summers days are only getting closer. Elliot&rsquo;s day started off like any other day, after waking up, he gets ready for the day ahead by putting on his uniform, eating breakfast, and then his parents seeing him off.</p>
      <p><q>Nice weather we&rsquo;re having eh?</q> Harry mentioned to Elliot as they continue to walk. After a few silent moments, Elliot removes his headphones and looks up at the sky.</p>
      <p><q>I don&rsquo;t know, I guess</q> He agreed as he put in his headphones back onto his ear. Elliot spends another few minutes watching the single cloud drifting by and closes his eyes. In that moment, he suddenly gets tapped on the shoulder.</p>
      <p><q>What is it, Harry?</q> Elliot asked as he opens his eyes just to find his old friend. Sam yawns as he greets the two with the usual nod. Elliot and Harry nod and greet him back as they get closer to the station.</p>
      <p><q>No fair, I want to learn how to walk and sleep too!</q> Sam complained as he runs past the two guys into the station.</p>
      <p><q>Yo! You guys are lively this morning.</q> Jack waves from the station as the three arrive later than he expected. <q>Sure, took your time huh? Haha! All good, let&rsquo;s hurry up and get to classes&hellip; I hate being late for Newmark&rsquo;s class.</q></p>
      <p><q>Ugh, that Newmark?</q> jibed Sam to Jack&rsquo;s remark. <q>At least I get to sleep on the train</q> he groans as he flips out his wallet and grabs his train pass.</p>
      <p>The mornings usually bring the four of them together as they all have similar times for their classes and have been the best of friends since high school. The train ride seemingly lasting forever as they travel past the quiet countryside into the bustling city center where the university campus is located.</p>
      <p><q>Ah man, if there&rsquo;s one thing I can&rsquo;t get used to it&rsquo;s definitely gotta be riding that train for so long</q> Elliot announces as he nudged the slumbering Sam sitting next to him prompting him to wake up.</p>
      <p><q>Let&rsquo;s go.</q> Harry added.</p>
      <p>They all get off the train at their stop and begin walking towards campus. The short walk is pleasant and they even pass by a couple of cute girls on the way to the university. <em>Oh quick don&rsquo;t look&hellip; They were cute though</em>, Elliot thought.</p>
      <p><q>Ah, just now those girls were really cute.</q> Jack mentions as he nonchalantly looks back at them. They notice him so they smile and wave at him and he returns the gesture. The four guys exchange friendly banter and enjoy the warm spring morning before entering the building. Having different classes in the morning, they all part at the entrance and head to their respective classes.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Elliot enters his classroom then immediately searches for an empty spot near the back. His search is rewarded when he finds an empty seat at the back row right beside the window. <em>Lucky!</em> Elliot thought as he makes his way over to the empty seat. The professor enters the classroom to begin the class but not getting enough sleep the night prior, Elliot slowly and surely drifts away to sleep.</p>
      <p><q>&hellip;liot.</q></p>
      <p>A voice reaches out calling for something.</p>
      <p><em>How much time has passed since I fell asleep? I don&rsquo;t wanna wake up&hellip;</em></p>
      <p><q>Elliot!</q> He suddenly snaps awake only to find the empty class and his friend Jack before him.</p>
      <p><q>Yo sleeping beauty. You good?</q> Jack joked about.</p>
      <p><q>&hellip; Just a little tired. What are you even doing here anyways?</q> Elliot asked as he gets up to view the clock. Damn. It&rsquo;s already lunch? Jack shrugs and begins to walk towards the door.</p>
      <p><q>I&rsquo;ve come to pick up the Princess. Let&rsquo;s go have lunch at the usual?</q> Jack laughed and continued walking right put the door.</p>
      <p><q>All right I&rsquo;m coming.</q> Elliot sighed as he followed Jack towards the cafeteria. They walk from the second-floor university classroom over towards the first floor cafeteria where Harry and Sam were sitting at the usual table.</p>
      <hr />
      <p></p>
      <p><q>Yo.</q> Sam and Harry greeted the two and they sit down. <q>You know</q> Sam mumbles <q>Why don&rsquo;t we ever have any girls around us?</q> Harry, Elliot, and Jack all sigh in unison.</p>
      <p><q>Maybe when you can bring in some girls for us, we will have girls. Until then it&rsquo;s only gonna be us here at the table. So, work hard!</q> Elliot encouraged Sam. They continue eating and finish before the start of the next class. <em>Gotta go wash my hands</em>, Sam thought as he stood up.</p>
      <p><q>Ah. I&rsquo;ll meet up with you guys in class, I have to wash my hands</q> He motioned as he walked away towards the men&rsquo;s washrooms.</p>
      <p><q>Don&rsquo;t come back until you&rsquo;ve found a girl.</q> Jack said tauntingly.</p>
      <p><q>I won&rsquo;t be able to come back then you idiot!</q> Sam retorted.</p>
      <p>The three head towards the classroom while Sam goes to the washroom. <em>I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep last night either, but at least I didn&rsquo;t fall asleep in the middle of class like Elliot, haha!</em> Sam praised himself. Giving into the sudden urge to yawn, he stretches out his arms and bumps into someone roughly.</p>
      <p><q>Ow!</q> the small figure yelped.</p>
      <p>It took Sam a moment to realize that the small figure that he bumped into was a fellow university student who was focused on her phone. <em>Oh damn, Jack&rsquo;s not gonna believe this one.</em> The gleeful though passes his mind almost as quickly as he forgot that she&rsquo;s still on the ground.</p>
      <p><q>Oops, my bad! Are you okay?</q> Sam apologized as he motioned his hand towards the girl on the ground to help her up.</p>
      <p><q>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;m okay. How about yourself?</q> the mysterious girl takes Sam&rsquo;s offer and uses his hand to hoist herself back up. Sam takes a good look at her when she gets up and the atmosphere immediately becomes awkward.</p>
      <p><q>Ah. Sorry for not introducing myself. I&rsquo;m Sam, 20 years old, and I happen to be a second-year Modern Languages and Literatures student.</q> He explained concisely. Her eyes widen and she suddenly seems to be livelier.</p>
      <p><q>Oh! I have a friend doing the same thing!</q> She smiles brightly. <q>My name is Lily, aged 19, and I&rsquo;m currently an Education student. It&rsquo;s nice to meet you Sam.</q> She displays another cheerful smile and dusts herself off. Woah. She&rsquo;s cute. After a moment of silence, she says goodbye and begins to walk away.</p>
      <p><q>Wait!</q> A powerful urge makes Sam call out to Lily as she begins to walk away. Confused, she turns around and examines him. <q>I know we just met, but maybe we can exchange numbers? I&rsquo;m usually with a group of guys and I don&rsquo;t exactly have that many friends either so maybe&hellip;</q> Sam struggles to find the right words to say but Lily giggles as she knows what he&rsquo;s trying to say.</p>
      <p><q>Sure, I usually hang out with a group of girls too and I don&rsquo;t exactly have many friends either, so I would be glad to be your friend!</q> Lily beams at Sam and then proceeds to run away towards her classes.</p>
      <p><q>See ya!</q> They say in unison.</p>
      <hr />
      <p><q>Sam is late for class. The Prof already started the lecture so if he comes now then he&rsquo;s going to get in trouble.</q> Harry whispered to the others while Elliot struggled to stay awake and Jack struggling to pay attention.</p>
      <p>The entrance doors to the lecture hall swings open and behind it is Sam with a big grin on his face. The three guys are stunned as he runs from the front to the back where they were sitting.</p>
      <p><q>What the hell is this guy thinking&hellip;</q> Jack whispers loudly as his eyes track Sam all the way to where they are seated.</p>
      <p><q>Sam. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re so excited to be in my class. I would ask that you would refrain from being late again and making such a ruckus. Thank you. Now we can get back to the lesson at hand&hellip;</q> The Professor warned as he continued where he left off.</p>
      <p><q>Real smooth dude.</q> Elliot jokes and he tries to contain his laughter.</p>
      <p><q>You guys are real pieces of work.</q> stated Harry while staring at the front of the room where the professor is. They quietly chit-chat until they&rsquo;ve had their fill.</p>
      <p><q>Hey Sam, why were you even late to this class? You were literally right behind us&hellip;</q> Jack asks while trying to still focus on the lecture.</p>
      <p><q>You are not gonna believe this. I went to the washroom and accidently bumped into a really cute girl and she gave&mdash;</q> Sam eagerly mentions. The three guys&rsquo; jaws all drop as soon as Sam get interrupted.</p>
      <p><q>Bullshit.</q> Jack interrupts Sam in the middle of his sentence. <q>Good joke, dude. You&rsquo;re 100 years too early to try and trick that with us, we just know you too well.</q></p>
      <p><q>Maybe he&rsquo;s not lying though.</q> Harry objected as he turns to face the group instead of uselessly trying to focus on the lecture.</p>
      <p><q>C&rsquo;mon guys, you think I would be lying about this?!</q> Sam persisted as he pulls out his phone from his pocket. <q>See look! Her name is Lily.</q> He insisted as his phone sudden lets out a subtle vibrate indicating that he had received a message.</p>
      <p><q>Oho, seems like our little Sam is quite popular nowadays</q> Elliot sniffled as he pretended to cry tears of joy. <q>So, who is it?</q> They all sit quietly as they wait for Sam to retort but to no avail as he just sits there staring at his phone.</p>
      <p><q>What&rsquo;s wrong?</q> Harry asks as he tries to look at Sam&rsquo;s phone from an angle. He manages to catch a glimpse of the sender and sees the name ‘Lily&rsquo; in the sender line.</p>
      <p><q>&hellip; She wants to meet up after classes today. She&rsquo;s going to bring her friends and she said to bring you guys.</q> Sam softly claimed as the four guys falls silent.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>The class is finally over. The group pack their stuff gingerly as they don&rsquo;t exactly know what is going to happen from here on out. Harry and Jack are the first ones to rise out of their seats, energetically they smile and try to usher the rest of the group out of the lecture hall and into the hallway. The university is packed with many students going in and out of classes and study halls but the group find a bench on the third floor to sit and discuss their game plan.</p>
      <p><q>Okay so, Lily said we should&mdash;</q> Sam begins but is quickly interrupted by Harry.</p>
      <p><q>I call first dibs.</q> Harry pronounces with gleaming eyes.</p>
      <p>The guys look at each other and begin to laugh uncontrollably.</p>
      <p><q>Oh, man Harry. Haha! We&rsquo;re just going to be friends with these girls, we need them to be in our group. Don&rsquo;t make us look like horny teenagers&hellip;</q> Jack pleaded as he was catching his breath from laughing so hard.</p>
      <p><q>Harry&hellip; He&rsquo;s right. Like I was saying. We need to head over to the first-floor cafeteria and find an empty table so we can wait for them there.</q> Sam explains, he then grabs his bag and gets up off the bench. <q>Let&rsquo;s go, yeah?</q> He smiles.</p>
      <p><q>Don&rsquo;t worry guys, I&rsquo;ll find the best table for the ladies to enjoy.</q> Harry persisted confidently. <q>They will become ours!</q> The monotonous manner of speech that Harry uses almost makes his statement seem sarcastic but the group knows that he&rsquo;s serious.</p>
      <p><q>Harry, you can do whatever you want but please just don&rsquo;t be too out of control.</q> Elliot sighs. The remaining guys on the bench get up and head towards the cafeteria but Sam suddenly stopped as he realized that the group of people in front of them was Lily and some other girls.</p>
      <p><q>That&rsquo;s uh&hellip; That&rsquo;s them; right in front of us.</q> Sam notifies the group. Just as he points towards them one of the girls from Lily&rsquo;s friends turns around and sees Sam pointing at them.</p>
      <p><q>Hey&hellip; You got a problem, little shit?</q> The girl aggressively questions the group. Lily turns around to face the aggressive girl.</p>
      <p><q>Senna, what&rsquo;s wrong?</q> Lily asks; her eyes wander to the group in front of Senna and she sees Sam.</p>
      <p><q>Hey Sam! It&rsquo;s me!</q> She cheerfully shouted. <q>Girls, this is the guy I was texting you&hellip; and I guess these are his friends.</q> Lily looks back at the group of guys and analyzes them. They exchange greetings and then mention that they should find a table to sit down, so they do.</p>
      <p><q>Just so you know&hellip; I don&rsquo;t like you guys.</q> Senna declared as she glares at them. The two groups sit on opposite sides of the table. The awkwardness and tension in the air is unbearable; Harry is the first one to say anything.</p>
      <p><q>Hey! My name is Harry. I&rsquo;m 19 years old, and I&rsquo;m a second-year Business student. Nice to meet you all.</q> He confidently announces.</p>
      <p><q>I&rsquo;m Jack. I&rsquo;m 21, and a Conflict Resolution student. Let&rsquo;s get along well.</q> Jack adds.</p>
      <p><q>Heya, I&rsquo;m Sam. I&rsquo;m 20 years old and I&rsquo;m a Modern Languages and Literatures student&hellip; The quiet guy over here is Elliot. He&rsquo;s 20 years old and he&rsquo;s a Biology student. He&rsquo;s super smart but he kinda gets nervous around people he doesn&rsquo;t know. Haha.</q> Sam chuckles but then gets shoved by Elliot.</p>
      <p><q>Hey&mdash;!</q> Objected Elliot, refusing to make eye contact with the girls. <q>Don&rsquo;t go giving people the wrong idea.</q> He argues. Lily smiles and gestures her friends to introduce themselves.</p>
      <p><q>Tsk. I&rsquo;m Senna. 22 years old. Environmental Studies is my major.</q> Senna responded grudgingly. After a quick sneer at Harry she looks away.</p>
      <p><q>Good afternoon. My name is Primrose, I&rsquo;m 20 years old and I am a Philosophy student. Let&rsquo;s get along well.</q> The seemingly cold girl added; her emotionless expressions make it hard to tell what she&rsquo;s feeling.</p>
      <p><q>Hello Everyone! My name is Lily. I&rsquo;m 19 years old and I&rsquo;m in the faculty of Education.</q> Lily cheerfully announced with no regard to the tension and awkwardness in the air. The last girl to Lily&rsquo;s right stays quiet as if she is nonexistent in the conversation <q>Ah sorry, she&rsquo;s really shy to new people but she&rsquo;s super loveable! Her name is Camilla, she&rsquo;s 22 and Chemistry is her major.</q> Lily added.</p>
      <p><q>Lets all get along together!</q> the two groups gingerly state in unison</p>
      <p><q>I guess this is where our real university life finally starts, right guys?</q> Harry whispers to the guys and laughs.</p>
